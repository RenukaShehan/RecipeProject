        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Jackfruit: Clean the young jackfruit by removing the outer skin and the core. Cut it into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Cook Jackfruit: Boil the jackfruit pieces in a pot of water until they are tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare Spice Mix: In a small bowl, mix cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and chili powder with a little water to form a paste.</li>
<li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. When they start to splutter, add chopped onions, green chilies, curry leaves, minced ginger, and garlic. Sauté until the onions are golden brown.</li>
<li>Add Spice Mix: Add the spice paste prepared in step 3. Cook the spice mix for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
<li>Add Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they are soft and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
<li>Add Jackfruit: Add the boiled jackfruit pieces to the pan and mix well, ensuring the jackfruit is coated with the spice mixture.</li>
<li>Pour Coconut Milk: Pour both thick and thin coconut milk into the pan. Stir well and bring the curry to a simmer.</li>
<li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
<li>Check Seasoning: Taste the curry and adjust salt and spice levels according to your preference.</li>
<li>Serve: Once the jackfruit is tender and the curry has thickened, remove from heat. Serve hot with rice or flatbread.</li>
<li>Enjoy your delicious Polos Maluwa!</li>
